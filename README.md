## Computer Science Class Homeworks

these are some selected homeworks from my CS 2, CS 4, and CS 5 classes, in which I studied (or am studying currently in the case of CS 5) 
functional programming and abstractions, computer science theory, and programming language implementation and evaluation, respectively.

_there is no need to review every word of these in depth! they're just meant to give you an idea of what I've worked on during my academic
pursuits of computer science._
