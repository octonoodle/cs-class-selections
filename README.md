## Computer Science Class Homework Selections

My school's CS curriculum extends three years past AP CS A. It is derived from Northeastern University's Bachelor's-level Computer Science curriculum, which my CS teacher adapted from his classes as an undergraduate there. 

These are some selected homeworks from my CS 2, CS 4, and CS 5 classes, in which I studied (or am studying currently in the case of CS 5) functional programming and abstractions, computer science theory, and programming language implementation and evaluation, respectively.

_\*\*There is no need to review every word of these in depth! They're just meant to give you an idea of what I've worked on during my academic pursuits of computer science.\*\*_
